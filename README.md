# Supermicro 25 Pin Power Extension

This project is an extension cable for a Super Micro PWS-1K66P-1R power supply.
This power supply has a 40mm fan which is quite loud, but the design of many
servers does not leave enough space around the power supply to replace this fan
with a larger (and quieter) fan.  The connector on this power supply is a
proprietary 2x25 contact PCB edge connector that carries high (133 Amp)
currents, and thus needs a custom extension cable to move the power supply out
of the case to somewhere with more space.
